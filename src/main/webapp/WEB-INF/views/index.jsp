       Yerba mate is widely known as the source of the beverage called mate in both Spanish and Portuguese,
      also called various other names in Portuguese like chimarrão, and tererê/tereré. It is traditionally consumed in central
       and southern regions of South America, primarily in Paraguay, as well as in Argentina, Uruguay, southern and central-western
        Brazil, the Chaco region of Bolivia and southern Chile. It is also very popular among the Druze community in Syria and
         Lebanon, where it is imported from Argentina. Yerba mate was initially utilized and cultivated by the Guaraní people 
         and in some Tupí communities in southern Brazil, prior to European colonization. Yerba mate can also be found in various 
         energy drinks on the market today.
